My submission for CondoWork's UW Co-op Coding Test

package.json contains dependancies: readline-sync and puppeteer

after cloning the repo and running 
```npm install```
```
node ronaParse.js
```
or
```
node ronaScrape.js
```
will run the respective files.

ronaParse.js will promp the console to enter the file path to text files; alternatively
one could overwrite the filePath variable.
