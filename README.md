My submission for CondoWork's UW Co-op Coding Test

package.json contains dependancies: readline-sync and puppeteer
running
  npm install
 then
  node ronaScrape.js
 or
  node ronaParse.js 
 in the folder with a clone of this repo will run the respective file. . 

ronaSrape.js will promp the console to enter the file path to text files, alternatively
one could overwrite the filePath variable.
